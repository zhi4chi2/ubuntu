使用 help 命令获得 builtin 的帮助

```bash
me@mypc:~$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.

    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.

    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.

    Options:
        -L    force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic links in
        DIR after processing instances of `..'
        -P    use the physical directory structure without following symbolic
        links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before processing instances
        of `..'
        -e    if the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory
        cannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status
        -@  on systems that support it, present a file with extended attributes
            as a directory containing the file attributes

    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.

可以用 `help` 查看全部內建命令

```bash
me@mypc:~$ help
GNU bash, version 4.3.48(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
These shell commands are defined internally.  Type `help' to see this list.
Type `help name' to find out more about the function `name'.
Use `info bash' to find out more about the shell in general.
Use `man -k' or `info' to find out more about commands not in this list.

A star (*) next to a name means that the command is disabled.
